LoadingWidget
=============

An ESRI ArcGIS Flexviewer widget that displays a swf icon while a layer is loading.

This was created to replace an existing widget I used that displayed a progress bar.

This widget is designed to be appended to the UI Elements portion of the config.xml

# <widget horizontalcenter="0"  verticalcenter="0"  config="widgets/Loading/LoadingWidget.xml" url="widgets/Loading/LoadingWidget.swf"/>
